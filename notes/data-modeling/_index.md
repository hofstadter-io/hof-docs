Data modeling is at the core of Hofstadter.
Single-source of truth designs,
data models with additional context and configuration,
are the input to many of __hof's__ subsystems.
With `hof datamodels` you will be able to:

- define data models in a single location and format
- generate database schemas, backend APIs, client side code, and more
- update the data models, calculate differences, and generate code to manage migrations across the stack
- share, import, and reuse your data models across your organization and the community

The following sections will take you through the life-cycle of `hof datamodels`
