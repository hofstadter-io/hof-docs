# Todo


### split first-example in two

for two personas / user stories

- user of a generator, trying to create powerful applications easily
- generator creator, builds reusable modules, builds for other devs

### think about it!

- schema driven development
- create mock services for development (hof has an optimization here in studios)
- express relationships, attach metadata (to entity nodes and relation edges)
- generate mock data from CUE values
- generate translations between versions (datamodel history idea here)

Example: federated graphql infra, when one updates, hard to update consumers


_side note, Hof should create a Backstage plugin for regenerative templates_
