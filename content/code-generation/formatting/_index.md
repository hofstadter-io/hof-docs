{{<lead>}}
Consistent formatting makes code more readable and understandable.
Hof automatically formats many languages with widely used defaults
while also providing a means to customize or add new languages.
{{</lead>}}

When you generate code with `hof` it will automatically format
the output for known extensions and languages.
This typically happens by running a container in the background,
though some languages are handled directly in `gocode`. (See below)

`hof` will start a container the first time it is needed for you.
You can fetch, run, and stop formatters manually with the [hof fmt](/code-generation/formatting/format-command/).

We have built several [hof/formatters](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/tree/_dev/formatters)
which use the most common tool for a language and use the most commonly used rules.
You can build your own and configure generators to use them too,
see the [custom formatters](/code-generation/formatting/custom-formatters/) section



## Supported Languages

If a language you need is missing, [open an issue](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof-docs/issues/new?title=hof%2Ffmt%3A%20add%20support%20for%20%3Clanguage%3E).
If you can, please provide a link to a common tool used for that language.
