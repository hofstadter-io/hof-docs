title: Relations
brief: "between types"

weight: 50
---

To add relations to our types and code, we need to do a few things.

- add relations to the schemas and example
- update type template to add fields and helpers
- update our custom code in the resource handlers


### Updating Schemas

Recall that the core `hof/schema/dm.#Datamodel` has a `#Relation` with two strings, `Reln` and `Type`.
To show you how we can calculate extra fields from existing ones,
we will modify our example `#Datamodel` schema,
which already extends `hof`'s core `#Datamodel`.

Here, we add a `GoType` field for template rendering

{{<codePane title="schema/dm.cue" file="code/first-example/data-layer/content/schema/dm-reln.html">}}


### Updating Design

We of course need to add the relations between our types
to the datamodel we are using for our server.
Note how we do not have to add `GoType`.
It will still be available in our template input though.

We specify that a User has many Todos
and that a Todo belongs to a User.

{{<codePane title="example/dm.cue" file="code/first-example/data-layer/content/examples/dm-reln.html">}}


### Type Template

We now need to implement type relations in our templates.
We show the whole file here as much was added.
Note

- We stored the top-level TYPE in `$T` so we can reference it in nested template scopes.
- some edge cases in the `*With*` helpers are omitted and left to the user.

{{< codePane title="templates/type.go" file="code/first-example/data-layer/templates/type.go" lang="go" >}}


### Custom Code

We change

- `UserReadHandler` to use the new library function `UserReadWithTodos`
- `TodoCreateHandler` to have a username query parameter and assign the user. Note, we would normally determine the User with auth and context.

{{<codeInner lang="go">}}
func UserReadHandler(c echo.Context) (err error) {

	username := c.Param("username")

	// note the changed function here
	u, err := types.UserReadWithTodos(username)
	if err != nil {
		return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusBadRequest, err.Error())
	}

	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, u)
}

func TodoCreateHandler(c echo.Context) (err error) {

	var t types.Todo
	if err := c.Bind(&t); err != nil {
		return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusBadRequest, err.Error())
	}

	username := c.QueryParam("username")
	if username == "" {
		return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusBadRequest, "missing query param 'username'")
	}

	u, err := types.UserReadWithTodos(username)
	if err != nil {
		return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusBadRequest, err.Error())
	}

	t.Author = u

	if err := types.TodoCreate(&t); err != nil {
		return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusBadRequest, err.Error())
	}

	return c.String(http.StatusOK, "OK")
}

### Query Param

We also need to add a query parameter to an automatically generated route from a resource from our datamodel.

For now, we added it manually to the handler, as in the code just above.
We leave addition of this query paramater as a thought experiment.

- Can you conditionally add it in the `#DatamodelToResource` helper? (hint, this is probably the complex, but better way, check for `Reln == "BelongsTo"`)
- Can you unconditionally add it through the example design? (hint, you will need to unify with the generator `In`)


### Regen, Rebuild, Rerun

We can now `hof gen ./examples/server.cue`.
If you see any merge conflicts, you will need to fix those first.

Try rebuilding, rerunning, and making calls to the server to create users and todos.

{{<codeInner lang="sh">}}
// make a user and a todo
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{ "Username": "bob", "Email": "bob@hof.io" }' localhost:8080/user
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{ "Title": "hello", "Content": "world" }' localhost:8080/todo?username=bob

// read a user and a todo
curl localhost:8080/user/bob
curl localhost:8080/todo/hello
{{</codeInner>}}


### Commentary

Some comments on the difficulties of data modeling, templating, and the spectrum of languages and technologies.

- type and relation generation is going to language and technology specific
- hof aims to maintain an abstract representation
- users can extend to add the specifics needed
- we expect that middle layers will capture common groups like SQL, OOP, and visibility (public/private)
- best practice is to use labels which are not likely to conflict, can always namespace and nest

and the complexities with multiple

We'll also see better ways to construct the library later,
when we introduce `Views`.
