In a more advance setup, we might separate the client into a separate module.
A user could easily swap technologies, like Vue and React for the frontend,
but this can extend to any component in the system.
Such capability requires having a shared schema, or atleast data model schemas.
You can also create a wrapper generator around others,
while managing the one to many schema transformations.
