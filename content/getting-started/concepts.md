`hof` was designed from first principles to
enable higher productivity when
developing software and applications.

...


## Single Point of Truth (SPOT)

There is a lot of repeatedness in writing code.
From databases, to APIs, to frontends,
we have to replicate and move our data models
through the layers. At each layer, many of the parts
look the same with different names and values.

___What if we could write down our data model once
and generate the majority of the code to support it?___

With `hof`, we write down our conceptural model once using CUE.
We call this the _"design"_, which fits a schema,
and is combined with text templates to create the output.
You can leverage existing designs and modules
or create your own without modifying `hof`.
The idea is to use the singular application design
to automatically create the majority of the implemenetation
across the many technologies and languages.

___How does this work when I change my design or need to write custom code?___

...

From here we can create all the things and write our own code intermixed with the generated code.
We can be iterative as well, __hof__ understands the changes and updates it's part
to not only update schemes, but also write code which manages rolling updates gracefully
across the application technology stack.


## Designs and Data Models

The data model is core to any application.
In __hof__ we write data models using CUE
and enrich them with extra context and options.
These are what we call the "design" for your application.
It's very similar to types or classes
with annotations as in other languages,
written as configuration in CUE,
which has many nice properties purpose built for this task.

Your designs conform to the schemas of the modules you use.
Schemas define the context, options, and configuration for a module.
As you incorporate more modules, you will add to your designs.
This is where the enrichment on the data model largely comes from.

Some common enrichments on the data model:

- relationship between data models
- restricted and / or combined data views
- who can access or modify the data
- what technologies to use and their details when needed

Designs are merged with modules and code generators when you run the __hof__ CLI tool.
The modules and code generators will use your designs to generate applications and their pieces.


## Code (re)Generation

__hof__ was born from the dream that we ought
to be able to write our idea down once
and have a tool to generate a complete
application from that.
Not only the application, but much of the
process and life cycle components of
real production software.

So in __hof__, the companion to designs are _code generators_.
These read in your designs, have logic to condition output,
and uses text interpolation to generate files for just about anything.
While most users may only write designs, code generators are where
the schema and template files define what is possible.
Typically these are grouped in a module.


## Polyglot Modules

Modules in __hof__ are a flexible and reusable implementation of the
Minium Version Selection (MVS)
dependency managment algorithm popularized by Golang.
They are polyglot because they can contain any of:

- technology choices
- code generators
- sub-modules and dependencies

A common workflow for using a module is:

1. add a module as a dependency
2. import that module's schema and generator
3. setup the generator and update design for the schema
4. run __hof__ to generate code and use the module


## Customization

__hof__'s core is designed to enable
customization and enhancement in all concepts.
The most important is we understand that
complete applications cannot be generated
and that they themselves will need
custom code and integrations.
With __hof__ you can write your code
within the generated code.
Care is taken to keep everything intact
through design updates, regeneration of code,
and your own coding no matter the order.

You can also customize and extend any of the
designs, code generators, and modules you use and create.
This was another core tenament of __hof__'s design,
how to have another order or two of code reuse.
With the shared designs and code generators
we are already improving code reuse drastically.
When you customize or extend other modules,
you can keep the base you build on up-to-date.
With granular customization and the dependency system
you can fine tune modules and ensure correctness.

#### data model:

- abstract/conceptual, write in CUE, input to code gen
- Single Point of Truth (SPOT)
- checkpoint & track history (like db migrations)
- auto migration calculation & more with history
- it's like an intermediate representation
- data model + config / generator options

#### code gen:

- declarative programming (like IaC, DSLs)
- data + templates = _
- a generator is schemas & template
- any language or technology
- control over the generated code
- support integrated custom code
- regeneration when data model changes

User fills in data model & schema to gens used,

When combined with the data model history
even more complex code can be automated.

#### modules:

- any git repo with a `cue.mods` file
- any combo of data model & code gen
- all dep managed & composable
- framework to enable ecosystem
