  Developer experience with Hofstadter.

### __hof__ was built to improve developer workflow.

<br>

{{<lead>}}
There were a few problems we encountered too often
{{</lead>}}

##### 1. Redundent code patterns

    a. when writing api handlers, client libraries, and data validation
    b. standard server setup like logging and wiring up the router

##### 2. Data models changes require making the same conceptual change across many files

##### 3. There are good boilerplates and starter projects out there, but once you start, it becomes hard to incorporate their updates

<br>

{{<lead>}}
We wanted a tool where we can...
{{</lead>}}

- write down our conceptual design in one place
- run a tool to create most implementation
- work directly in the output like writing normal code
- update our designs and regenerate our implementation
- keep and continue our existing custom work
- share designs across teams and projects
- import advanced functionality into our apps

<br>

### This is what __hof__ helps you do.
