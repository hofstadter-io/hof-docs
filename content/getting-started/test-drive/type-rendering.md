### Generating Types

move to next section?

(maybe just discuss all of this?)

One of the more common questions for CUE
is how to generate the matching types in a language.

More advanced walkthrough and discussion in...

1. CUE, Schema, and some types
1. Generating Go types
1. SQL & TS (multiple languages)
1. REST & DB lib stubs (not just types)

(show how to convert to a generator module)

Briefly mention and link to

1. Generating types from more vanilla CUE (field: string, rather than DSL)
1. Generate for a framework
