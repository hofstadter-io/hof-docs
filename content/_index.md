### __hof__ was built to improve developer workflow

<br>

{{<lead>}}
There were a few problems we encountered too often
{{</lead>}}

##### 1. Redundant code patterns

When writing api handlers, client libraries, and data validation.
When starting server setup like logging and wiring up the router.

##### 2. Data model changes

Requires us to make the same conceptual change across many files.
Also manage databases, schemas, migrations, and coordinated deployments.

##### 3. Fleet wide fixes and updates

Deploying shared security and bug fixes across our app fleet should be easier.
This should apply equally for improvements in our code patterns and practices.

<br>

{{<lead>}}
We wanted a tool where we can...
{{</lead>}}

- write down our conceptual design in one place
- run a tool to create most implementation
- work directly in the output like writing normal code
- update our designs and regenerate our implementation
- keep and continue our existing custom work
- share designs across teams and projects
- import advanced functionality into our apps
- extend functionality without modifying the tool

<br>

### This is what __hof__ helps you do
